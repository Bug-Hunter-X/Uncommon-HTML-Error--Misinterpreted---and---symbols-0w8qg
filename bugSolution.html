<p>The solution is straightforward: escape the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols using their HTML entity equivalents, <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code>, respectively. This tells the browser to treat these characters as literal text rather than HTML tags.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with escaped less-than &amp;lt; and greater-than &amp;gt; symbols.&lt;/p&gt;</code><p>By replacing the literal characters with their HTML entities, the browser will correctly render the text without attempting to parse them as tags.</p>
