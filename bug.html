<p>This is a common error that can be frustrating to debug. The issue is that the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols are not being correctly interpreted by the browser, which is looking for HTML tags instead. This error is often found in situations where you're attempting to output text directly from a backend or data source into the page without properly sanitizing the output.
